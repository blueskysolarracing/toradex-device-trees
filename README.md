# Introduction

This repository contains device trees, device tree overlays and related header
files for TorizonCore tools to use. The repository is automatically kept in
sync with the Toradex Linux kernel git tree and the device tree overlay git
tree.

For more details how to use them refer to the [Developer Website
Article](https://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/device-tree-overlays).


# toradex-device-trees (IMPORTANT)

The bssr dts to load is dts-arm64/bssr.dts
This repo should be in the tcbdir directory so you may have to do some mv commands

## How to push the device tree
```bash
torizoncore-builder dt apply toradex-device-trees/dts-arm64/bssr.dts
torizoncore-builder union custom-branch
torizoncore-builder deploy custom-branch --remote-host 10.0.1.53 --remote-username torizon --remote-password bssr --reboot
```
# Toradex Guide for BFM Development
This guide should give a summarized overview of how to work with the Toradex 
board used to control the BSSR BFM.

It is recommended to use a unix environment to interact with the Toradex board
and to do any developmment on it since Toradex uses a Linux-based OS.
For windows, this means installing a vm, wsl, or dual booting.

Listed below are a few useful resources:

4. Ixora Development Board Datasheet: https://docs.toradex.com/101430-apalis-arm-ixora-datasheet.pdf

## Connecting to the board over SSH
* The board is interacted with using ssh
* This means you need to connect the board to the shop wifi using ethernet or 
    an antenna
* First, you should join the BSSR wifi on your computer
* Connect to the board by using the command to torizon@apalis-imx8-07107494
    * Note that "torizon" is the board username and "apalis-..." is the hostname

## Testing and Running code on the board
From this point, it will be assumed that you have ssh'd into the board

### Docker Speedrun
Toradex uses Docker to organize programs on the board. If you are not familiar
with Docker, it basically allows you to create a bunch of virtual computers 
called containers in Docker lingo on a device  so you could install different operating systems, 
programs, and libraries on each of these virtual computers. They are all 
running on the same hardware though. On the Toradex board, you can run the 
command "docker" in the terminal to see a list of available options. A basic 
command you can run is docker ps -a which displays a list of all the running 
and stopped virtual computers (AKA containers).

### Running code
This is one way to test and debug code on the Toradex code.

A testing container called "romantic_bouman" was created using docker commands.

1. ssh into the board
2. Run the command "docker ps -a" and ensure that romantic_bouman is listed
3. Run the command "docker start romantic_bouman"
4. To gain access to the conainer's terminal run "docker exec -it romantic_bouman bash"
5. Now your shell should change. You are ssh'd into the toradex board and now you have just
accessed a virtual computer running on the board.
6. Run the command "cd ~" to enter to the home directory where you should see
a few python scripts in the directory "torizon_tests"
7. Run "python name_of_script.py" to run test code
8. You can use a text editor installed in the container to quickly edit code such as
nano, vim, or nvim which can be installed using terminal commands.

# Editing Pinout Configuration on BFM
The Toradex itself comes with its own pinout configuration already applied, meant for one of the development boards that you can buy from their website.

However, should you not want to be wire constrained when designing a PCB for a toradex module running through, say, a SODIMM slot, you may want to know how to edit the pinout configuration to your custom preference.

## The Premise
Custom pinout configurations effectively mask a pinout configuration file over the default pinout configuration (Device Tree Overlay -> Device Tree -> Torizon OS).
The “Device Tree” refers to the lookup table of pins being configured to GPIO, I2C, SPI, etc.

The overlay simply changes a few of those default pins, then it's **masked** over the default device tree, then the OS executes instructions and sends data out the configured pins accordingly (or receives data).


## Configuring pins (Device Tree Overlays)
In the link https://developer.toradex.com/torizon/os-customization/use-cases/device-tree-overlays-on-torizon/#approach-1-applying-device-tree-overlays-to-an-image-using-a-single-torizoncore-builder-command
follow the steps to be able to compile and upload a device tree overlay. Device Tree Overlays (DTOs) are used to modify what pins on the board do what (Ex: GPIO, AN_ADC, SPI, ...).
Below is a condensed version of this guide.

### Checking for Torizon Core Builder
Torizon Core builder is Toradex’s own firmware tool (terminal command) to make changes and “build” the chip for your purposes. 

First you need to understand the BFM debugging setup:

- The SSH connects directly to the board
- Torizon Core is installed and edited on your OWN machine, or on any server that might have remote access to the BFM
- To install Torizon Core Builder, you need to first install windows linux subsystem, WSL.
  - [How to Install WSL](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Install-WSL-03083e3332fb462b8d6c5398cad48e4a?pvs=21)
    
- After installing WSL you should be able to install Torizon Core Builder **inside** the WSL by following the following commands
    - `mkdir -p ~/tcbdir/ && cd ~/tcbdir/`
        - creates a directory
    - `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toradex/tcb-env-setup/master/tcb-env-setup.sh`
        - grabs the source code
    - `source tcb-env-setup.sh`
        - build the source
- You can then check that it’s properly installed by running and seeing no errors
    - `torizoncore-builder --help`
- If you would like to install docker, you can follow the commands here
    - [Installing Docker on Windows via WSL - Dataedo Documentation](https://dataedo.com/docs/installing-docker-on-windows-via-wsl)

### Editing the Device Tree
If you are using Windows then use the WSL terminal. If you are using Mac or Linux, just use the regular terminal.

1. First enter WSL
2. Then enter docker by typing `sudo systemctl start docker` you can test it has started by typing `docker run --rm hello-world`
    1. There are some known issues where a previous exit code error prevents docker from starting in the next instance.
[How to Fix control process exited with error code.](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Fix-control-process-exited-with-error-code-58f8e90e803e436da9dba986e18a1727?pvs=21)
1. Then start the `tcb-env-setup.sh`, start `torizoncore-builder -h` 
2. Install dependencies and packages
    1. To get the files that correspond to the current board, we need to execute the following with the toradex connected to the bssr network (ie. plug in an ethernet cable) and your computer connected to the bssr wifi.
        ```bash
        # 10.0.1.53 is the board local IP address
        torizoncore-builder images download --remote-host 10.0.1.53 --remote-username torizon --remote-password bssr
        # Wait a while ...
        # torizoncore-builder dt checkout # Commented since this downloads the device trees but this repo already has them
        ```
        
    2. This should create a directory in tcbdir called device-trees
    3. The device trees should be in the directory tcbdir/device-trees/dts-arm64/
    4. You can copy an existing device tree to a new .dts file in this directory and add any changes
    5. You can find how to mux pins by looking in device-trees/include/dt-bindings/pinctrl/pads-imx8qm.h and referencing the datasheet https://docs.toradex.com/105526-apalis-imx8-datasheet.pdf. Muxing pins changes the original functionality to an ALTX pin as specified in the datasheet.
    
3. Push changes to the board by running the commands
```bash
torizoncore-builder dt apply toradex-device-trees/dts-arm64/bssr.dts
torizoncore-builder union custom-branch
torizoncore-builder deploy custom-branch --remote-host 10.0.1.53 --remote-username torizon --remote-password bssr --reboot
```

To actually create your own overlay, you can create a new file in the overlays directory that is inspired by some of the other overlays.
When configuring pins that have multiple functionality (what the docs calls pin multiplexing) the current board uses constant definitions located in the following directory:
 ```
tcbdir/device-trees/include/dt-bindings/pinctrl/pads-imx8qm.h
 ```

An example device tree overlay is seen below where <IMX8QM_USDHC2_DATA2_LSIO_GPIO5_IO28 0x104>
configures the USDHC2_DATA2 pin to be GPIO5_IO28.

```
/dts-v1/;
/plugin/;

#include <dt-bindings/pinctrl/pads-imx8qm.h>

/ {
    compatible = "toradex,apalis-imx8";
};
&iomuxc {
       pinctrl-names = "default";
        pinctrl-0 = <&test_regen>;


        apalis-imx8qm {
                test_regen: gpiogrp {
                        fsl,pins =
                                <IMX8QM_USDHC2_DATA2_LSIO_GPIO5_IO28 0x104>;
                };
        };
};
```

### More control with Device Trees
Sometimes Device Tree Overlays do not give you enough control.
In this case you maight have to modify the Device Tree.

After following the "Configuring Pins" section:
1. Make a copy of the Device Tree being used which is imx8qp-apalis-v1.1-ixora-v1.1.dts
2. This has a few includes of other .dtsi files that specify the actual peripherals
3. You can then apply this copied and edited device tree using:
```bash
torizoncore-builder dt apply device-trees/dts-arm64/bssr.dts
torizoncore-builder union custom-branch
torizoncore-builder deploy custom-branch --remote-host 10.0.1.53 --remote-username torizon --remote-password bssr --reboot
```
